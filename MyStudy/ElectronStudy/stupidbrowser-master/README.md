# stupidbrowser

This is a stupid browser basic browser I built using Electron with Webview.  My goal is to make this a browser where I can intercept web requests and alter parameters sent to a server.   I put this together to get input from users to make this a better browser.  I can't find many good examples of using webview in Electron.
